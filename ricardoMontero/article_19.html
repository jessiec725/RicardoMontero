          <h1>UFC 205 Announced at MSG Press Conference</h1>
          <h4>October 18, 2016 by Ricardo Montero</h4>
            <img class="article_imgs" src="img/UFC.jpg">
            <div class="article_para">
              <p style="text-align:center;"></p>
            <p>For the first time in history, the Ultimate Fighting Championship will have an event in the state of New York. UFC 205 will be hosted at the Madison Square Garden and it was announced at a press conference on Sept. 27.</p>
            <p>This year, New York voted to legalize pro mixed martial arts effectively revoking a ban enacted in 1997, becoming the very last state to do so in the U.S., and on Nov. 12 the legendary arena will be the host of yet another historic event.</p>
            <p>UFC President, Dana White, said, “This card has three world title fights and is the best card in UFC history.”</p>
            <p>There were only rumors of who would fight at UFC 205 in the days prior to the press conference, but as the fighters stepped out onto the stage of The Theater at MSG and greeted New York for the first time, the card that many MMA fans had dreamed of was finally a reality.</p>
            <p>“There has yet to be a card like it,” said UFC fan, Jessie Castellanos. “Not only that its going to be in New York City. We are having the pleasure of seeing the greatest fighting event that has ever existed .”</p>
            <p>The headliners will be no other than the UFC’s — and one of modern sport’s —biggest stars, Conor McGregor, who will fight Eddie Alvarez for the UFC lightweight title, attempting to become the sport’s first fighter to simultaneously hold titles in two weight classes.</p>
            <p>The Irishman and featherweight champion took over the press conference, hurling insults at any fighter that dared challenge him, especially at his opponent Alvarez.</p>
            <p>When the lightweight champion teased McGregor to “take it easy” during a rant by McGregor, he responded, “Or what? Or what? What you gonna do? Or what? You gonna do something over there? Shut your f***ing mouth. I run New York. I run this whole sh*t.”</p>
            <img class="article_imgs"src="img/UFC_2.jpg">
            <p>However, White said that if McGregor wins, he will not be a dual title-holder.</p>
            <p>“He wants to try to gain both belts and he will give up one of the titles after that fight in New York,” White said.</p>
            <p>McGregor disagreed, saying “I’m gonna wrap one [belt] on one shoulder, I’m gonna wrap the other on the other shoulder, and they’re gonna need a f***ing army to come take them belts off me.”</p>
            <p>The crowd of around 250 fans, and even some members of the press, would laugh, gasp and shout while the fighters insulted each other with a hostile grace that only fighters seem to truly have. A dangerous swagger of confidence and violence, emphasized by their muscular builds and designer suits filled the atmosphere of the theater, challenging their own human mortality.</p>
            <p>Tyron Woodley and Stephen Thompson will be fighting for the welterweight title and Joanna Jedrzejczyk will face Karolina Kowalkiewicz for the straw-weight championship, and these are only the three championship fights in a card filled with famous and highly profitable fighters.</p>
            <p>The UFC predicts the profit for the UFC 205 pay-per-view to be the biggest one ever, making this event not only historic for the state of New York but for fighting sports over all.</p>
