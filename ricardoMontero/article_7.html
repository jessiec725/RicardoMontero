          <h1>The Elements of Journalism</h1>
          <h4>March 6, 2017 by Ricardo Montero</h4>

              <p style="text-align:center;">News Literacy in the Digital Age</p>
              <p>To the common folk, journalism must seem like a pretty common and straight forward concept. An event takes place, a journalist goes and finds out information about that event and reproduces that information in the simplest form possible in order to reach and inform the largest audience. It is not rocket science, but by simplifying journalism to a simple one, two, three step program, the public ignores the deep-rooted and perpetual philosophical questions that every event, story or bit information poses for the journalist, which creates a complicated disconnect between the public and the journalist and it makes the story fall into the trap of individual interpretation.</p>
              <p>The deepest and most important element of journalism, and also its most problematic, is the truth. Whether defining the truth or reproducing it, the journalist must make a decision on what the abstract concept of truth really means, and how the variables around it affect its ultimate meaning. Bill Kovach and Tom Rosentiel, authors of “The Elements of Journalism,” said that  Journalism seeks “a practical and functional form of truth,” which is a concept ethical and logical in nature, but not perfect in the overall concept truth, and certainly not a concept that everyone can get behind. However, for the emotional and professional development of the journalist, accepting that even perfect truths can be debated and defending the practical and functional truth in order to maintain order in society, is essential.</p>
              <p>Truth is a matter of perspective, even when it is not, and the journalist must not get caught up in the debate.</p>
              <p>Another important truth is that journalism provides citizens with the information necessary to be free and self governing. That is a gigantic responsibility that is not always spoken or appreciated by the citizens, but that it takes a giant deal of trust by the journalists, who must trust the citizens to handle the information in ethical ways. The journalist must also hope that once the citizens self-govern freely, that this self-government will be benign and non-destructive, which is entirely up to the citizens but by assistance from the journalist. If the information given causes destruction or chaos, it is partially the fault of the journalist, but that is not necessarily an evil thing. The journalist does their job correctly and whatever happens after that is up to the the moral code and IQ scores of the citizens.</p>
              <p>While truth is debatable, fact checking is the journalist’s best shield and their sharpest sword. Objectivity of a piece relies on the objectivity of it’s facts, and the discipline of the fact-checking that goes along with it. Avoiding personal and cultural bias in order to defend a point gives the journalist credibility and courage, even ignoring their own ego for the sake of the truth and their loyalty to the structure of society.</p>
              <p>Finally is the independence and courage that it takes for a journalist to be an independent monitor of power, disregarding personal or social influences and remain faithful to the truth.  The journalist must ignore the education of a dollar bill or a promise or the strength of power in order to do their job without putting in jeopardy their integrity.  Journalists are “watching over the powerful few in society on behalf of the many to guard against tyranny,” Kovach and Rosenstiel said, even if that tyranny comes from their own authority figures. However, once again, the journalist must not fall into the trap of fight and resist at all times and must be as fair with their reporting of tyranny as they are with the reporting of good deeds.</p>
