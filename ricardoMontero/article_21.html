          <h1>NJPF Winner:Arguing Gun Control Arguements</h1>
          <h4>September 10, 2016 by Ricardo Montero</h4>

              <p style="text-align:center;">Staff Writer for The Torch Newspaper</p>
            <p>Humans should not limit themselves to simple yes or no opinions due to the influence of society. Correct decisions are not one of the two opposing ideas, and important decisions should not be made in that sense. For example, Democratic and Republican, pro-choice and pro-life, for or against gay marriage, religious or atheist, pro-gun or against.</p>

            <p>These political controversies are not perfect ideologies for there to be only two choices in each matter, therefore people should not feel oppressed to choose one or the other and blindly abide by the group’s rules and beliefs. So, why do you do it?</p>
            <p>Outside influence has been proven to make people blind, oblivious and ignorant to their own free will; from religious groups all the way to political parties, and all the way back to gun control, which is an issue that the United States has not been able to deal with properly.</p>
            <p>Particularly in this issue, it is a necessity to listen and appreciate the reasons as to why the other party believes what they do, regardless of whether or not you agree with them; there is a reason for their position in the controversy.</p>
            <p> There are many arguments regarding the gun control issue, most of them valid, but nothing is going to get fixed if there is not a type of compromise. These two groups of people are blindly agreeing and denying without listening to each other’s reasoning, leaving us with two groups of angry, senseless mobs who wish for resolution but with no way to help resolve the issue.</p>
            <p> Simply out of objectiveness, here are the majority of the arguments for and against the Gun Control Controversy according to BalancedPolitics.org. A sarcastic and skeptical dissection of these arguments is utterly necessary, that way perhaps we may reach a fair compromise.</p>
            <p>Arguments for stricter gun control: 1. most violent crimes are committed with guns. 2. The number of possible active shooters will be reduced. 3. A criminal may kill a victim with more ease if he or she has a gun. 4. Suicides and crimes of passion will be reduced. 5. The Second Amendment was targeted towards militia, not towards civilians or individuals. 6. Crimes that may have been less harmful may escalate due to the presence of a gun.  7. Legalized gun ownership means that guns can easily fall in the hands of children. 8. Local terrorism will be reduced.</p>
            <p>All of these arguments are valid; however, there are gaping holes on some of these. Most violent crimes are committed with guns but one is certain that you can kill people with almost anything; A criminal may kill a person whether or not he or she has a gun, there are too many factors there besides the simple possession of the gun itself; suicides may be delayed but not reduced, and crimes of passion can be committed with anything, at moments of extreme anger or fear a human does not think clearly, making guns optional at such times.</p>
            <p>Sadly, we cannot ask the men who wrote the Constitution to clarify on this matter, so that’s an eternal fight there. Are crimes more dangerous if a gun is added? How can one even measure the danger of a crime? Local terrorism may be reduced but only in terrorism involving guns, which leaves about half of an arsenal available, but I suppose the number can be a bit reduced.</p>
            <p> Arguments against stricter gun control: 1. Criminals will always find ways to obtain guns, leaving citizens defenseless. 2. Crimes are often prevented due to the presence of a gun. 3. The 2nd Amendment protects individual gun ownership. 4. Weaker individuals cannot protect themselves against assault and other such crimes. 5. Guns in possession of citizens are added protection against government tyranny. 6. Police are often too overwhelmed to protect all citizens. 7. Banning guns will create a black market for guns regardless. 8. Banning guns will take another piece of our liberty, inching us closer to totalitarianism. 9. Reasonable gun control can be set, so a ban would be unnecessary.</p>
            <p>These are all great points, but yet again, not good enough to convince the other party. I thought the job of law enforcement was to defend the citizens against criminals, and either way, it is illegal to kill people whether criminal or innocent, and vigilantism is illegal as well. Crimes are often prevented because one of the parties has a gun? At which point the victim becomes the aggressor, still making it a crime. The second Amendment is once again mentioned, our forefathers should have explained that better.</p>
            <p>There are other ways to defend oneself against assaults, and some ways do not involve murder; if we wanted to prevent ourselves from government tyranny, the answer was to not have any government at all but that did not work out. Police officers have back up and even SWAT teams to help them, random citizens with guns are not a very reliable ally; black markets for guns already exist everywhere on the planet, so that would not be much of a change. Finally whether or not the government chooses to become totalitarian, they have more than enough resources to stand up against civilians with guns, making a revolution very difficult to carry out.</p>
            <p>The only truly concrete argument here is that a reasonable gun control law can be passed, leaving both parties with half of their desires met, making the controversy much easier to deal with. Starting with larger caliber assault rifles, these should be banned since they are made to kill large numbers of people and nothing else, which makes the argument of self-defense seem weak, since a regular individual does not need this type of weaponry to defend a suburban home or wherever they may live. Citizens prescribed with anti-psychotics or any type of said drug should not be allowed to obtain a weapon, since the medicine may make them unstable and easily violent. Obligated education should be put in place for gun owners, teaching them ways to protect their children or family members from their gun, and how to effectively storage their weapon.</p>
            <p>These are some steps that could be taken towards a more acceptable solution to the Gun Control controversy. Otherwise, a stand still will stay in place while the country watches more people die unjustly due to a poor compromising technique by our leaders: men and women who need to learn to compromise instead of continuing with their overly-developed skill of blind disagreement.</p>
