          <h1>NJPF Winner: Up in Smoke: Can Public Safety Monitor Smoking?</h1>

              <p style="text-align:center;">Staff Writer for The Torch Newspaper</p>
            <p>Someone told me once that nicotine relaxes the body and takes your mind off the essay that you are procrastinating on. However, 20.1 percent of adults aged 18-24 years old smoke, according to research by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and those are the ages of most college students.</p>

            <p>When cancer is the issue, it is up to individuals to agree on quitting, but what to do when the issue is smoking on campus? It is common knowledge around campus that if caught by Public Safety, the result is a $100 ticket, straight out of your pocket.</p>
            <p>Yet, the campus smoker does not care about the tickets or the signs, sometimes using the signs that say “No Smoking on Campus,” to put out the burning tobacco on their cigarettes. This is a situation clear to everyone on campus.</p>
            <p>It is not a mystery that society has a hard time with prohibitions, but if it did not work in American history it will not work here. Telling young adults to not do something, and expect them to subdue is ineffective, just ask any psychology major.</p>
            <p> Unless Public Safety carries out covert operations to catch these sly students, Bergen Community College must change its views towards smoking. “A few years ago,” said Communications Professor Peter Rose, “there used to be designated places for smoking, but kids did not use them, so smoking was just banned.”</p>
            <p> Students should be given the option to enjoy their smoking in designated areas without the danger of being ticketed, while Public Safety hunts down anyone who is not following the regulations. The smoking population of BCC will smoke regardless of how many signs are put up, and instead of issuing more tickets, smoking areas should be placed. With this idea, the smokers will do their thing while the smoking on campus remains under control, and non-smoking students do not have to cough at people so that they stop lighting up.</p>
            <p>There are smoking areas in all Disney parks, so if one can smoke near Cinderella’s Castle, why ban it at a community college?</p>
            <p>Simple observation has shown me that Public Safety is attempting to tackle this problem, but not quite getting the down. Rarely is there patrolling along the areas where smoking is most common. If one was to dissolve this problem, one should probably look for the columns of smoke rising up from a single area.</p>
            <p>At the very least, hold the ticket booklet to one’s face and look menacingly at everyone, attempting to intimidate the solution into this issue. If areas for smoking are designated, Public Safety officials will be able to catch the rebel smokers who skip the smoking areas and the fumes will be contained.</p>
            <p> Opposition to this idea is imminent; some might argue that it will not help and people will smoke everywhere, but why not give students a chance? Not everyone will be happy, but mutual cooperation is better than simple bias solutions.</p>
            <p>I carried out interviews in order to find out what the smoking population thought of designated areas. “It could work, at least I would use it if it got me off a $100 ticket,” said an anonymous source. Most students agreed; the rest of the responses I cannot print on a public newspaper.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it is time for change in regards of smoking at BCC. Perhaps it is time to trust the students to do the right thing. Perhaps it is time to hold hands with Public Safety and be friends. Can we do it? Yes we can.</p>
