          <h1>The Garner Protests Through the Eyes of a Journalist</h1>
          <h4>September 10, 2016 by Ricardo Montero</h4>
            <img class="article_imgs" src="img/garner.png">
            <div class="article_para">
              <p style="text-align:center;">Layout Editor for The Torch Newspaper</p>
            <p>There was police everywhere. It was 6:30 p.m. and I walked out of the Downtown A train, into 42nd St. Port Authority Bus Terminal station, the first thing I saw was a flood of NYPD officers roaming the underground tunnels of the subway like white blood cells, ready to attack any virus that might infect the delicate New York system.</p>
            <p>It was December 3, 2014.</p>
            <p>They all had the same nervous grimace on their face, which was made more evident whenever they would look at my chest and read “Press.” Most would turn away, others would give me a defiant look, which I pleasantly returned.</p>
            <p>I made my way up the terminal and into the fluorescent lights and loud honking of 42nd and 8th Ave., listening for any commotion or looking for any anomaly.</p>
            <p>Half jogged, half walked through 42nd street. I knew Times Square had the story and the iconic pictures. I raced agaisnt Eyewitness News Channel 7 and reached Dyquawn Thompson; a young African-American waving a white flag that said “Justice. Respect,” with a peace sign in the middle.</p>
            <p>“I need to stand up for what is right,” Thompson said. “There is a disconnection between the police and the people, enough is enough.”</p>
            <p>As Thompson waved his flag, more people came, some who were protesting injustice in Mexico, holding Mexican flags with red paint on them, and shouting to the heavens in Spanish.</p>
            <p>There was a white gentleman, Jerry Goralnick, in front of me, holding a sign with two faces.</p>
            <p>“Every 28 hours, this has been going on forever. Racism is systematic in our society.” read one side, where the other read “The law is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer.”</p>
            <p>“Racism in America is systematic. The biggest game here is real estate, and cops are like a gang. So the white shirt says to the blue shirt, this is your corner, keep it clean, and when a blue shirt sees a black guy selling single cigarettes in that corner, doesn’t look very good on the blue shirt, who just wants to impress his superior. Which can lead to a simple arrest turning into a murder. They are moving out the lower class, by any means necessary.”</p>
            <p>I lingered around Times Square in the bitter cold, until the sound of commotion and buzz of human anger grew closer. Coming downtown from 7th Ave. was a river of people and signs, and suddenly, I wasn’t cold anymore.</p>
            <p>Three groups fused together at the intersection of West 44th St. and 7th Ave, by some supernatural force, protesters coming from Downtown 7th, East from 44th and the group that I was with perfectly timed an encountered in the heart of New York, and it stopped beating.</p>
            <p>Traffic was at a standstill, as the crowd joined and became one, as the leaders of each group met in the middle to discuss their next strategy.</p>
            <p>Looking for possible aerial pictures and footage, I climbed on top of a garbage can with the help of another journalist, and we both shared our slippery makeshift platform for the sake of the shot, and for the enjoyment of our readers and viewers.</p>
            <p>They shouted in unison and waved their flags, raised their arms and held their signs until the leaders yelled “West Side Highway!” and like ants, the crowd obeyed and mobilized Northward on Broadway, to their next target.</p>
            <p>I followed them as they made a left on 47th St., and a right on 8th Ave. staying close to get the best pictures and footage I could as they went. The immobile cars honked and maneuvered, until the drivers realized the magnitude of the crowd, 2,000 people perhaps, and called their destinations, excusing themselves for their lateness.</p>
            <p>One image that shocked me most during the walk was a young African-American on a wheelchair, unassisted and free, protesting for his cause.</p>
            <p>News Editor, Blair DeLong, suggested through the phone that I should go to Rockefeller Center. I left the crowd at the corner of 52nd St. and 10th Ave, and power walked to 30 Rock. Headquarters advised me to be careful, since the lighting of the iconic Rockefeller Christmas Tree was taking place, but it had been infiltrated by protesters.</p>
            <p>I made it to 6th Ave and 50th St., where the police had barricaded the entire avenue. I cursed my luck and began walking Uptown, determined to slip through the cracks, stick to the shadows and bypass the police, which would probably be impossible, may Ethan Hunt inspire me.</p>
            <p>On my way to a miracle, I walked by a young white man, standing alone and holding a sign that read “NYPD. Blood on your HANDS.”</p>
            <p>I approached him. “Hello sir, my name is Ricardo Montero from The Torch.” He turned, looked at my press pass, at my face and smiled, “What’s up Ricardo, I’m Patrick Waldo.” I found him.</p>
            <p>We talked briefly, and then I asked him why he was there. His face grew red with passion and began. ”Today, I’m embarrassed to be a New Yorker. I am here to voice my opinion to the decision to not indict the NYPD officer who did an illegal chokehold on Eric Garner, even when he said “I can’t breathe” 11 times. I feel embarrassed to pay taxes to fund useless and racist cops.”</p>
            <p>I gave him a second to catch his breath, he sighed deeply and continued, “There is a system set in place that protects police officers from breaking the law. And there is a system of institutionalized racism in America” his voice filled with emotion. “As much as people like to say that racism is dead, it is very much alive. Serious changes to the system need to be made before this continues.” I thanked him for his service, he thanked me for approaching him.</p>
            <p>I walked all the way up to 56th St. and found a gap in the barricades, I ran to the other side of the Americas before the police saw me, and was able to jog all the way to 5th Ave. without being noticed.</p>
            <p>Using building courtyards, passages and alleyways, I was able to arrive at the other side of the street in front of Rockefeller Center. Headquarters wasn’t wrong, there were at least 3,000 people in my immediate space. I was stuck between humans and the barricades, unable to cross 5th Ave to the Rock, so I applied the only tactic that I had left, my press pass.</p>
            <p>“Oy! Officer! I’m press and I need to cover the lighting of the tree!” I yelled. The officer in question did not even turn around and continued to ignore me for the following eight minutes, until I gave up and grudgingly headed back to Times Square.</p>
            <p>The heart of New York was calm when I arrived. I stood by the TKTS pavilion, most commonly known as the red stairs, and watched a group of twenty-somethings gathered in a circle, praying to their god for justice.</p>
            <p>I decided that there was nothing more to report and looked at my watch, it was 10:00 p.m. I walked to Times Sq. 42nd St. subway station, putting away my camera and excited to go home. I was walking through a tunnel on my way to the A train, when I hear loud, terrifying screams coming from a woman’s vocal chords, and at least 30 cops standing at the mouth of my tunnel.</p>
            <p>I immediately went for my camera when I see an African-American woman being lifted by the limbs, her body parallel to the ground, and squirming from the grip of the law. The officers were yelling commands as her screaming continued, and a large crowd of onlookers gathered around the scene. I began to take pictures but an officer got in my way, and prevented me from getting a decent picture.</p>
            <p>She was swiftly handcuffed and taken away, while I switched to video. The buzzing of the crowd grew to a higher, louder pitch, and the officers turned their attention towards the gathering crowd. Then began pulling out their batons.  </p>
            <p>The officer’s commands rebounded off the walls of the narrow tunnel, while a young man came into my field of vision and said “God Bless America.”</p>
            <p>The crowd began moving away from the scene by the commanding voice of the police. I looked around and filmed, but stayed at a safe distance, when I noticed one of the officers, whose hand never left the holster of his gun.</p>
            <p>“Are you a reporter?” said the bearded man behind me on the escalator as I left. “Yes. Did you see what happened?” I asked the man. He handed me his business card.</p>
            <p>“Justin Lees, Guitarist,” it read. “What do you know Mr. Lees?”</p>
            <p>He was nervous, and asked me before he answered to keep him on deep background, so I had to talk him out of it. When he accepted, he said, “That woman asked the police for help. The police asked her for ID, but she did not have one. I don’t know what happened that led to her arrest, after she said she didn’t have ID, she screamed that the police couldn’t help her. Then something happened and here were are.”</p>
            <p>He spoke about his own experiences with the police, he talked fast and assured, and I simply listened. He denied my request for a picture as the Q train arrived at the station, and he shook my hand, turned with the guitar on his back, and left.</p>
            <p>I took my train in silence and went back to the security of my home, where the only social and political unrest is what will be for dinner, and things made sense again.</p>
