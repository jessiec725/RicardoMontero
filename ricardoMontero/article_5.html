          <h1>The Jones Rivalry Over, What's Next For Daniel Cormier?</h1>
          <h4>April 13, 2017 by Ricardo Montero</h4>
            <img class="article_imgs" src="img/uber.jpg">
            <div class="article_para">
              <p>Even though Uber Technologies Inc. had been lobbying in the state of New York since 2013, its efforts to spread from New York City to the rest of the state have been in vain. Buffalo, being one of the largest cities in the country without access to Uber, is a juicy market that Uber has wanted to devour for a while, blocked only by the dissonance between the Republican-controlled New York State Senate and the Democrat-led State Assembly.</p>
              <p>An attempt at a bill to allow Uber access to upstate New York was made on June 17, 2016, when the Senate passed bill S4108D, sponsored by Republican Sen. James L. Seward. The Senate floor voted 44 in favor and 17 against, and all 17 no’s came from the mouths of Democrats.</p>
              <p>To get the legislation passed, Uber had very specifically chosen Red Horse Strategies as their lobbying firm of choice, since their Managing Director of Campaigns, Aaron Hecht, had been involved with the Senate from 2009 to 2011 and had connections all over Albany.</p>
              <p>Eleven Republican and eight Democratic senators were being lobbied by Uber in the 15 day period before voting took place, with the company even giving Red Horse Strategies $77,194 the day before voting. While Democratic Sens. Gustavo Rivera and Diane Savino were lobbied, their vote was still no, but by then Uber had understood that their lobbying had been successful and that they could take individual Senators off their lobbying payroll.</p>
              <p>The bill was then passed to the Assembly, who referred the bill to the insurance and did not even bother to vote on it, leaving Uber drooling for that untapped upstate market. The bill suffered pushback from a coalition of taxi companies, most fiercely from the Upstate Transportation Association (UTA), a non-profit trade association for private passenger transportation companies, which formed just 15 days before the Senate vote, as a result of the incoming Uber avalanche. UTA wasted no time in doing some lobbying of their own, paying Bolton St. John’s, LLC, $20,000 in 2016. Their efforts proved fruitful as the Assembly sympathized with their cause and denied the bill originally passed by the Senate.</p>
              <p>The main argument by the opposition was that it did not require Uber drivers to undergo state-regulated background checks and fingerprints, and that it would put at risk the safety of the riders. In a June 3 press release, UTA spokesman Mark Ilacqua said “Upstate taxi companies already follow strict rules to protect New Yorkers, but billion-dollar ridesharing corporations want a free pass to skimp on safety and rake in profits.” Uber says that it already conducts background checks of its own and that fingerprinting is not necessary, and they do not intend on accepting the fingerprinting, given that they already suspended operations in Austin, TX, after residents passed a fingerprinting requirement.</p>
              <p>Sen. Seward then got to work on a new bill while Uber got to work pouring more money into lobbying firms. From January to December 2016, Uber spent over $80,000 in compensations to various firms such as Jenkins, Patrick B. & Associates and Kasirer Consulting LLC. While that number may seem high, it pales in comparison to the over $1.4 million that Uber spent on lobbying expenses last year, mostly to Red Horse Strategies, who received $374,630, and Canal Media Partners, who received $1 million for TV advertisements.  </p>
              <p>From July to December, Uber did not even bother worrying about the Senate. It threw the Senate some money, sure, but their targeting of individual Senators was over now that they knew that a friendly bill would pass the Senate without a problem. They instead focused on the Mayor’s Offices around the state, hoping to get some more friends in the Assembly in order to get the new incoming legislation passed once and for all.</p>
              <p>Finally, on Feb. 3, 2017, Sen. Seward showed up with a newly revised bill, and three days later it passed the Senate with flying colors. Fifty-five ayes to five nays was the voting, and once again, the opposition was Democratic. Sen. Rivera, despite having seen Uber money, stuck to his “no” for a second time along with four of his friends, unlike Sen. Savino, who this time voted “yes.”</p>
              <p>Governor Andrew Cuomo, facing a March 31 deadline for the state budget, had proposed a bill already which was similar to Sen. Seward’s, with one major difference: The Governor wants a 5.5 percent tax on all rides, but the Senator lowered it to 2 percent. So even if the legislation, which does not have an Assembly sponsor, passes in the lower house, Uber might run into Gov. Cuomo head-on.</p>
              <p>For now, the next obstacle would be the Assembly. The Democrats, more sympathetic towards the taxi drivers of the state, pose a problem despite Uber’s money and efforts to use Patrick Jenkins of the Jenkins, B. Patrick and Associates lobbying firm to get support from Assembly Speaker, Carl Heastie.</p>
              <p>Jenkins and Heastie just so happened to be dorm-mates during their days at SUNY Stony Brook University, a friendship that then went on to become a partnership, as Jenkins gets paid $4,000 a month to be the political adviser to Heastie. Ever since Heastie became speaker, Jenkins’ firm’s clientele has gone from nine during the 2013-2014 legislative session to 27 in the 2015-2016 session. From Uber alone, the firm has received $146,000 to lobby at a local level.</p>
              <p>Perhaps Uber is not only aware of the relationship between Jenkins and Heastie, but also of the fact that Jenkins served as Gov. Cuomo’s Deputy Campaign Manager during his successful run for governor, a personal connection that would come in handy in case the Governor, say, didn’t want to lower the tax on all Uber rides. What they are surely aware of is the power that lobbying firms and personal relationships have in Albany, and that despite the best efforts or interests of the people, the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.</p>
