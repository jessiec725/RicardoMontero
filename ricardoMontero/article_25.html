          <h1>As Strike Drags On, Verizon Feels The Weight</h1>
          <h4>September 10, 2016 by Ricardo Montero</h4>
            <img class="article_imgs" src="img/verizonWeight.png">
            <div class="article_para">
              <p style="text-align:center;">Editor-in-Chief for The Daily Ramen</p>
            <p>The strike had gone on for seven weeks already, but Fitz Boyce still stood outside of the Bryant Park Verizon store, booing at anyone that would dare go into the place that he and 22 other former Verizon employees were picketing.</p>

            <p>“It’s unacceptable,” Boyce said. “Our contracts ended Aug. 1, 2015. Instead of going out in August, we decided to work without a contract in the hopes of negotiating a fair contract for our members, but the company hasn’t improved their demands.”</p>
            <p>On April 13, the contract negotiations reached a boiling point when nearly 40,000 Verizon employees from Massachusetts to Virginia began a strike that still has no end in sight. However, with a $400 million union fund, the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers are not concerned with the length of the strike, since their workers are being paid to offset lost wages and benefits.</p>
            <p>“A fair contract is all we want,” Tony Carter, one of the picketers at the Bryant Park store, said. “We’re doing fine with the pay from the union, but we want to work for Verizon. That’s why we started working for Verizon in the first place.”</p>
            <p> On the other hand, the strike has had a financial and practical impact on Verizon. Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in a public statement that the company has seen a drop in its FiOS product, and device upgrades at its wireless business were also “very slow right now.” In early May, Verizon stated that it did not expect any operational setbacks, but in the latests public release, it explained the new installations were slower than usual and showed its financial plan to divert labor capital in order to repair and maintain regular services.</p>
            <p> Verizon has made the contract negotiations very public, even making commercials featuring their offers to the employees. When asked about the offers, Andrew Testa, a Verizon spokesman said, “Verizon is proud to offer more than 36,000 employees impacted by this strike with great careers that offer excellent wages, high quality healthcare and retirement benefits and so much more.” Testa said, “Our company is continually lauded as a great place to work, and that’s why more than 16,000 employees started new careers with Verizon in 2015, including more than 1,000 U.S. veterans.” He declined to comment on the ongoing talks.</p>
            <p>Unlike most contract disputes, the issue is not really the pay. Verizon wants to allow additional outsourcing of call center workers to the Philippines, India and Mexico, greater use of non-union contract installers and assignments of union employees to other cities for up to two months. These strategies are set to increase Verizon’s competitiveness in the telecommunications market, as well as gain greater flexibility and cover costs, as its telephone business shrinks and its wireless business becomes more important.</p>
            <p>“Verizon is an extremely profitable company,” Boyce said. “Yet to be competitive, they feel like they need to take away our benefits. We want to continue to put a good product out. We help built the FiOS network, we maintain these networks, and we should be respected as such.”</p>
            <p>While Boyce was talking, Adam, the manager at the Bryant Park Store location, looked at the picketers standing outside of his store. To Adam, the only thing separating him from possibly being fired was a thin sheet of glass. “We don’t answer any questions in-store, please contact Andrew Testa, he’s the media relations guy.” He asked not to be quoted directly.</p>
            <p>Verizon employees were afraid for their jobs if they showed any sign of cooperation with the picketers. If they said anything wrong or different from the script that the company executives provided, they could be terminated on grounds of insubordination.</p>
            <p>Politicians from New York and Massachusetts are supporting the strikers in an effort to bring an end to the strike. On Monday, the Syracuse, N.Y.city council approved a resolution in favor of the strikers, and claiming that Verizon is on a “campaign to destroy good jobs.” Syracuse marks the 16th municipal vote in favor of the unions in the regions currently in strike. Other cities supporting the strikers included Boston, Cambridge and Braintree, Mass.; and the towns of Babylon and New Paltz, N.Y.</p>
            <p>Not only has the political influence been regional. On May 19, U.S. Congress urged the strike to end. “We are troubled that the lack of a negotiated labor agreement could increase the likelihood that good jobs will be offshored to the Philippines, Mexico and other locations overseas or outsourced to low-wage, non-union domestic contractors.”</p>
            <p>U.S. Labor Department Secretary, Thomas Perez, and 88 U.S. Congress members have taken a stand on the strike. Perez met with Verizon and union leaders to ease communication between the two parties, and Congress issued a statement, urging the strike to end.</p>
            <p>“We urge the parties to negotiate in good faith and agree to a fair contract. We firmly believe it is in the public interest to protect middle class jobs, reduce outsourcing and offshoring, and ensure high quality telecommunications services to the public.”</p>
            <p>As the strike approaches its seventh week and an agreement still seems unreachable, no congressman or CFO seems to convince Boyce, Carter to meet Adam and Testa inside that Bryant Park Verizon store. Each of them have their own reasons to keep picketing, or keep working, for a behemoth feeling the weight of 40,000 ants.</p>
