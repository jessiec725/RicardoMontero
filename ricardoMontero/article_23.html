          <h1>NJPF Winner: Dropping it Like It's Hot</h1>
          <h4>September 10, 2016 by Ricardo Montero</h4>

              <p style="text-align:center;">Staff Writer for The Torch Newspaper</p>
            <p>The college freshmen dropout problem has not been recent shocking news or some kind of unknown mystery. This problem has been transcendent throughout most of the decade, However, the reason to why students have decided to leave college in order to thrive in the fast food industry is a complex issue.</p>

            <p>Everyone wants to blame the economy for everything. The national debt this, minimum wage that. It is true that higher education costs money, but we are attending a community college with affordable pricing, yet we have a 12.6 percent success rate as of June 2011 according to Kathleen Donovan from The Record.</p>
            <p>What is going on? Is it because Ender Hall is a 10 minute walk? Cannot be, everyone loves the cardio.</p>
            <p>There are various factors affecting this rate such as the unreadiness of freshmen, economic instability and simply society, problems happening all across the nation.</p>
            <p> Freshmen are in a new environment and yes, it takes time to adjust to the changes, but students have to understand that this is not high school, where you are helped and pushed forward to graduate.</p>
            <p> BCC will do what it must to hand you the degree, but you must do the work and motivate yourself to a brighter future. Unless you are Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg then by all means drop out.</p>
            <p>The unpreparedness or sometimes reluctance to do work affects the student’s grades, which could eventually bring an “f,” for failure to adapt.</p>
            <p>“We’re going to do what we can but you guys have to do the work,” said Nestor Melendez, Dean of Judicial Affairs. “We’re doing programs trying to keep students in school, the goal is putting students from year one to year two.”</p>
            <p>Then there is the economy. Not everyone leaves due to poor performance.</p>
            <p>Amongst adults 18-34 who lack a bachelor’s degree, two-thirds dropped out to support a family. Out of these students 57 percent preferred to work, and 48 percent claimed not to afford college, PEW study shows. It is understandable that some students can do without the long-term debt, however it definitely brings some long-term happiness.</p>
            <p>Now all these percentages and statistics are scandalous and unacceptable, but we cannot ignore what is perhaps the greatest problem that the United States is currently facing; society.</p>
            <p>Let us be realistic, students these days are more worried about how many followers they have on Twitter than staying up all night to study for a test. Failure is not longer frowned upon; it has become something acceptable in today’s culture.</p>
            <p>The government and the institutions may do everything in their power to provide higher education for the masses, provide millions for universities, but there cannot be education without educated people, and the educated become fewer every year.</p>
            <p>Students come to Bergen Community College seeking guidance, but in order to be guided you must be willing to follow. Students would like to make money, live in the 90210, purchase a Bugatti and rap their life away without having to read a book. Well, wouldn’t that be nice, but we as students deserve more than being a simple statistic. Now that you have been introduced to the problem, think about becoming part of the solution.</p>
