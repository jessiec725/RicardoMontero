              <p style="text-align:center;">News Literacy in the Digital Age</p>
              <p>Journalists are the eyes and ears of the public, tasked with showing and telling the truth regardless of circumstance. Whether a journalist is thrown into a war-torn country or put under the deadly winds of a hurricane, it is expected of them to release accurate information, nothing more and nothing less.</p>
              <p>It does not matter how dangerous the situation is, a journalist is expected to remain absent of feeling or opinion that might put in peril the integrity of the piece, risking personal safety for the good of the public. In the case of Brian Thevenot of The New York Times, it was not personal safety concerns that lead him to release false information, but the overwhelming sentiment of panic and despair lived during Hurricane Katrina.</p>
              <p>In his article “Katrina’s body count could reach 10,000,” Thevenot gave false stories a national platform and did not try to verify numbers or accusations made by people in clear distress. Thevenot used assertion without factual evidence or reliable resources, and during terrifying times, the last thing thing the public needs is false information to spread even more panic.</p>
              <p>Even though Thevenot wrote the story using quotations from sources such as Arkansas National Guardsman Mikel Brooks, he did not verify his claims on his own or used official government sources or evidence to support Brooks’s stories, which at the end turned out to be false and incendiary. “Brooks and several other Guardsmen said they had seen between 30 and 40 more bodies in the Convention’s Center’s freezer,” was one of the assertions published but never checked, and it produced false images of absolute terror that were of no help to the victims of the Hurricane.</p>
              <p>However, that wasn’t the worst of Brook’s accusations. He said that he heard that a girl approximately 5-years-old had been gang-raped. “There was an old lady that said the little girl had been raped by two or three guys,” a brutal and horribly violent accusation to make, but an even worse thing to publish without serious verification. Statements like this create false scenarios in the public eye that might actually affect the income of aid, further damaging the situation.</p>
              <p>Although Thevenot is not directly responsible for other people’s lies, he is responsible for what is published under his name. His name will not be ignored just because he wrote down someone else’s accusation. It is his responsibility to understand the power that a national publication has and the effects that it could have on the readers.</p>
              <p>If the source quoted is not an official source, then the information provided needs be verified, especially if the source in question is in a chaotic environment.  If the source is an official source, the information should still be verified regardless but the blame of spreading falsehoods would fall on the official source and not on the journalist. When Thevenot quoted Mayor Ray Nagin saying that “the storm may have claimed more than 10,000 lives,” he was quoting an official government source with the most available resources to make that statement, regardless if the number was true or not.</p>
              <p>Thevenot might not have lied since the word “lie” implies malicious intent, and in the case of a journalist, sensationalist stories sell more papers. It is possible that Thevenot found himself in a violent and chaotic scene that might’ve swayed his better judgement, and he decided to trust and publish opinions of people in the same environment. Perhaps doing another profession, Thevenot might have been forgiven by the public eye because of course, it’s only human to make mistakes in environments like that, but journalists have to forget their own humanity sometimes, and Thevenot could not.</p>
