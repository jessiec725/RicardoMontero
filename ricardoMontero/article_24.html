          <h1>In Military and Disease, Young Love Prevails</h1>
          <h4>September 10, 2016 by Ricardo Montero</h4>
            <img class="article_imgs" src="img/youngLove.png">
            <div class="article_para">
              <p style="text-align:center;">Editor-in-Chief for The Daily Ramen</p>
            <p>Milo, the dog, sat in the back of U.S. Army Specialist Isabel Melendez’s 2015 Hyundai Elantra. He looked up at U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Jonathan Melendez as the family car approached a friend’s house where Milo would be staying, while the soldier and the Marine spent a week in military training.</p>

            <p>The training would precede deployments that will separate them for what, at that moment, was an unknown length of time. That was not the first time military duties interrupted their relationship and it would not be the last.</p>
            <p>“[Military relationships are] extremely difficult. If you’re in a unit that deploys, a great deal of trust is needed as well as patience,” said former Marine Blair DeLong. Even as, according to the Defense Department, the divorce rate amongst men and women in the military was 3.1 percent per 1,000 people in 2014—the most recent year for which the data are available—the Melendezes say joining the military is what brought them closer together.</p>
            <p>“It is not normal in the civilian world to get married at the age that we did,” she said. “But in the military, everybody sees it as, ‘Of course you’re married, you’re in the military. You’re doing it for the benefits.’”</p>
            <p> Jonathan, 20, and Isabel, 19, spent almost a year apart before they married. During that separation, they were linked only through letters and phone calls, while Jonathan, a combat engineer in the 1st Combat Engineer Battalion, trained in California, and Isabel, now an Army apecialist in the 40th Infantry Division, trained in New York with the 104th Military Police battalion.</p>
            <p> “The only way we could be with each other was if we got married so we could live together,” her husband said.</p>
            <p>On June 23, 2015, he wore his dress Marines Blues while the then Isabel Seda wore a long white dress and white sandals. They married at the New Milford Borough Hall, N.J., after four years of dating, two years of which had been in secret.</p>
            <p>Isabel’s Christian parents wanted her to focus on school. “They still wouldn’t know [that I was dating Jonathan] if it wasn’t for my cousin.” She said her cousin told Isabel’s aunt about the relationship.</p>
            <p>But once they were married, her father’s only request was for them to live together and for her to finish college.</p>
            <p>After the wedding, Isabel asked to be transferred from her unit in New York to a new unit in California. Since, they have lived together in Carlsbad, Calif.</p>
            <p>Originally, Isabel had also tried enlisting in the Marine Corps. That way, through the “Join Spouse Program,” which allows married couples in the same military branch to be within 100 miles of each other, being together would have been easier. But she was disqualified from joining the Marines for undisclosed reasons.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, Isabel went to an Army recruiter and became a United States soldier.</p>
            <p>She’s part of the Army National Guard Reserve, a part-time position. That allows her to attend nursing school.</p>
            <p>Isabel, a straight-A student, tried to convince Jonathan to complete a career. However, Jonathan had other plans. He enlisted in the Marine Corps while still in high school, and while he was confident of his decision to enlist, during senior year his alopecia areata manifested.</p>
            <p>Jonathan first began losing round patches of hair on his legs, then his arms, and eventually his head. He would hide it as much as he could to avoid possible bullying and misconceptions from his classmates.</p>
            <p>“People thought I had cancer,” Jonathan said. His insecurities affected his friendships and his self esteem, but his biggest fear was that his illness would possibly put his military career in peril.</p>
            <p>Eventually, in order to prevent the illness from affecting his relationship as well and with the support of Isabel, Jonathan decided to completely shave and accept his incurable condition. Patches of hair sometimes grow back, but for the most part, Jonathan is completely bald throughout his whole body.</p>
            <p>As it was to be expected, the alopecia areata did not affect his involvement with the Marine Corps, but he still deals with uncomfortable questions and judgements from those who do not know about his condition.</p>
            <p>He wants to be on a Special Weapons and Tactics—SWAT—team once he leaves the military and she wants to be a nurse. His contract with the Marines is four years; her contract with the Army National Guard is for six.</p>
            <p>During summer 2016, Jonathan will be deployed to an unknown location and Isabel will wait for him at home in Carlsbad, with Milo.</p>
            <p>They know about divorce rates among military couples. But they have bigger fears; the other not coming home. They agree that they are ready to die for their country, but they also have a marriage to fight for.</p>
            <p>“The military might own us,” Jonathan said. “But we own our relationship.”</p>
