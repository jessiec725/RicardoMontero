          <h1>Did the First Presidental Debate Decide Decide the Election</h1>
          <h4>October 19, 2016 by Ricardo Montero</h4>
            <img class="article_imgs" src="img/elections.jpg">
            <div class="article_para">
              <p style="text-align:center;"></p>
            <p>The first debate between Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, and Republican candidate, Donald Trump, sealed its place in political American history as the most-watched debate ever, in one of the most controversial presidential elections ever.</p>
            <p>According to Nielsen, the company that tracks TV ratings, over 80 million people across 13 channels tuned in for the live broadcast. This, of course, does not count every single person who saw it across all media platforms or those who saw it in groups, so the number is most likely closer to 100 million.</p>
            <p>Nielsen data also confirms that a vast majority of viewers watched the entire debate and ratings stayed high throughout all 98 minutes, which is particularly significant given the polarizing nature of the current election and the shrinking attention spans of the 21st century.</p>
            <p>Climate change, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, jobs, the ‘Birther’ movement, taxes, NATO, America’s nuclear arsenal and stop-and-frisk were just some of the topics that captivated audiences on Monday, and put fact-checkers to work.</p>
            <p>CNN’s Reality Check Team were particularly ruthless towards the Republican candidate who, out of 17 fact-checked claims, 11 were deemed false, three were true, two were true but misleading and was one mostly true. These were only statements that were made by the candidate himself and do not count the times he denied a true statement by Clinton.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the Democrat was much more factually correct with 12 true statements, one mostly true and one true but misleading statement. Clinton was able to take control of the debate and put Trump on the defensive, which made it easier for her to attack with true statements and not be forced as often to deny any factual attacks from Trump.</p>
            <p>However, for a moment Trump was able to counterattack with his statistics on how effective ‘stop-and-frisk’ had been in New York and even mentioned Clinton’s 1996 “superpredators” quote, as she was referring to African-Americans. Clinton was forced to retract a statement she had made earlier in the debate that ‘stop-and-frisk’ had not worked in New York when in fact, crime rates did lower. This attack from Trump was his most effective of the night and could have been significant on the polls had Trump stayed on topic, but he would continue to speak and his rant would overshadow his attack.</p>
            <p>Clinton was able to make the best out of the record breaking audience by attacking Trump throughout most of the debate, and was able to show more than 80 million people her composure and veteran command of American politics. She only found herself in trouble during discussions on ‘stop-and-frisk’ and the TPP deal, but was able to brush it off and attack Trump directly, which would distract the Republican and put him on the defensive.</p>
            <p>Without a doubt, Trump was best when sticking to his facts and preparation, but he was not able to ignore his ego and was easily distracted by attacks on his business and his personality. Towards the end, it was obvious that Trump had forgotten about his policies when he said “She spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads about me, many of which are untrue. It’s not nice and I don’t deserve that,” while the discussion was about Trump’s comments on women. Shortly thereafter, the debate ended, Clinton and Trump shook hands and walked off stage.</p>
            <p>The people at home did not take long to vote for a winner. On Tuesday, Trump tweeted a picture of some social media polls that claimed he had won the debate, without taking into account that these polls do not meet an editorial or scientific standard and can be easily hacked or manipulated  — one of the polls, from the ‘Patch’ news website, even gave Trump an 85 percent lead over Clinton.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately for Trump, scientific polls carried out by CNN and Politico/Morning Consult poll showed that Clinton was clearly the winner with 62 percent and 49 percent respectively. These polls had an enormous sample audience giving the record-breaking ratings, and are able to offer a more complete look at the country’s opinion than previous presidential debates.</p>
            <p>The candidates will prepare for their next debate, scheduled for Oct. 9. Clinton, Trump and their advisors will study the film with what they did right, wrong and what they could have done better as the country prepares to change hands again for the first time in eight years.</p>
