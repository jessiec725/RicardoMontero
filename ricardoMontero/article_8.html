          <h1>Undocumented, Uncertain and Unafraid</h1>
          <h4>December 20, 2016 by Ricardo Montero</h4>
            <img class="article_imgs" src="img/ricky_7.jpg">
            <div class="article_para">
              <p style="text-align:center;">Editor-in-Chief of The Daily Ramen</p>
              <p>The undocumented community is restless. Across the nation, men, women and children are feeling the weight of the United States closing in on them, eager to push them out, but they still have over a month to decide their next move before the U.S. makes theirs. In his 100-day plan published in October, President-Elect Donald Trump vowed to reverse every one of President Obama’s executive actions. He promised mass deportations and the elimination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and on January 20, the undocumented community will finally find out if Trump is a man of his word.</p>
              <p>DACA grants undocumented individuals who arrived in the United States before 16-years-old temporary amnesty from deportation and eligibility to work legally. Applicants must not have a criminal history,they must be enrolled or have finished high school or have been honorably discharged from the military, amongst other requirements. If Trump gets rid of DACA, every undocumented individual would be eligible for deportation and will no longer be allowed to work legally. While he has now said that he only plans to deport people with criminal records, being undocumented and working illegally are technically already crimes, so it is unclear what his definition of ‘criminal’ is.</p>
              <p>The uncertainty of the days to come has crept up through the states, into cities, through the neighborhoods and into the halls of CUNY schools, targeting students that feel abandoned by the American people. “This is a safe space for you to discuss concerns,” said the email that Cristobal Luis Aviles, Student Services Specialist from the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs at Hunter College, sent me, surely acknowledging the nervousness of having undocumented individuals come out in public. He invited me to a DACA forum on Nov. 30 at the Roosevelt House, “to be informed about what can be done now under our new presidential administration.” Over 100 students attended the event.</p>
              <img class="article_imgs"src="img/unafraid.jpg">
              <p>The Panel consisted of Cesar Vargas, the first DACA recipient to be licensed to practice law in New York; Joseph Lavetsky, immigration attorney at CUNY Citizenship Now!; and Dr. Martin Pino, Counselor at Hunter College. The audience consisted of DACA recipients, DACA hopefuls, documented immigrants and American-born students.</p>
              <p>“Trump has said that he wants to end DACA,” said Lavetsky to the anxious-looking Latinos, Asians, Africans and Americans in the room. “It could happen and that would be unfortunate, but we don’t know, so you should try to renew your DACA if you are within 6 months of expiration.” The students took notes. He also said that there is a possibility that the federal government might use their DACA information to find them for deportation.</p>
              <p>The greatest concern, as voiced by the students, was that their information would be shared with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) or the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency (USCIS). “Can Trump give an executive order to force New York to give away our information?” a student asked.</p>
              <p>“Mayor De Blasio said that he will not share your info,” Lavetsky said, “but De Blasio can be forced to do it if there is a judge order or a warrant,” like the kind you give to criminals. “Just 2 years ago I got arrested in Iowa for stepping and trespassing, but am I a criminal under Trump? Maybe. It is subjective,” Vargas said, an undocumented individual himself. “We have to define the label of the good immigrant versus the bad immigrant because that in itself is dividing us.” Semantics matter in law, but ever since Trump was elected, definitions of what is right and wrong have been challenged and there is a struggle of power over established rules.</p>
              <p>However, undocumented individuals still have a hand to play. The President-Elect relies on the cooperation of cities and states to carry out mass deportations. While he will have full authority to change the Department of Homeland Security’s deportation priorities and single out what groups should be targeted for removal, he would still need the help of local governments to gather information and find people to deport.</p>
              <p>Some cities such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago have pledged to be “sanctuary cities,” that have policies to protect from mass deportations. Some prohibit local police from asking people they arrest about their immigration status or refuse to obey immigration officers unless they have a warrant. It is not only up to governments to choose to become sanctuaries though, it is up to universities as well.</p>
              <p>Colleges across the city, such as The New School and New York University, have pledged to become “sanctuary campuses” and refuse to willingly help the federal government deport people. The “sanctuary campus” initiative has made it’s way to CUNY, and it’s what brought Isabel Mendoza and others to the front of the CUNY Central Office of Human Resources on a cold December evening.</p>
              <img class="article_imgs"src="img/unafraid_2.jpg">
              <p>“This protest is to ensure that CUNY is a sanctuary school,” Mendoza said. “[CUNY Chancellor] Milliken has not released an official statement pledging to be a sanctuary school yet, and we want him to sit down with actual students to discuss how exactly it is going to be a sanctuary school.”</p>
              <p>While Chancellor James Milliken has in fact released three statements since the election assuring the immigrant community that they will be protected, he has not specifically said “sanctuary campus.”</p>
              <p>“We will do everything legally possible to ensure their security and their place at the university. For CUNY, this is not just a pledge, it is a commitment demonstrated by our history as the clear leader among universities in this country in the support and services provided to immigrants,” said Milliken in one of the statements. “Forty percent of CUNY’s undergraduates are immigrants, which is one of the primary reasons this university is so full of energy and ambition, and is such a vital contributor to New York’s success.”</p>
              <p>Yet, Mendoza was not satisfied with it. A native from Tijuana, Mexico, Mendoza is a Political Science major at the City College of New York and a Skadden, Arps Honors Program in Legal Studies member, and is undocumented.</p>
              <p>Her and a few others wrapped a gift full of signed petitions from CUNY students to make CUNY a sanctuary campus and left it at the lobby of the office building for Milliken.</p>
              <img class="article_imgs"src="img/unafraid_3.jpg">
              <p>Amongst the protesters was Francisco Aquino, a Biology and Political Science major from Lehman College and a native of Puebla, Mexico. Aquino has been living undocumented in the U.S. for 19 of his 21 years, and is worried that CUNY might give his information to the authorities. “I don’t need to be worrying about my school giving away my information just to give the Trump administration numbers,” he said.</p>
              <p>A crowd of 20 or 30 people joined together on the sidewalk in front of the building and chanted things such as “undocumented and unafraid” and “education not deportation.” Police officers stood in front of them and instructed them to keep from blocking off pedestrian traffic, but did not feel the need to put up barricades.
The sight of young students protesting reminded Angelo Cabrera, 42, of his time as an activist for undocumented immigrants. He went on a hunger strike in 2001 to secure undocumented students in-state tuition in CUNY and SUNY schools. Originally from Puebla, Mexico, he came to the U.S. at 15-years-old. He has been undocumented for 25 years and now has a Masters’ in Public Policy from Baruch College.</p>
              <p>“Our biggest fear is the unknown for the future of deportation. The big fear is to get our information shared with USCIS. A lot of people could get deported,” he said. “New York maybe be a sanctuary but the college is still not.”</p>
              <img class="article_imgs"src="img/unafraid_4.jpg">
              <p>The uncertainty of a Trump administration holds the world’s attention, and the anticipation created by outrageous campaign promises and the demonization of entire groups of people. For undocumented individuals like Vargas, Mendoza, Aquino and Cabrera, it represents forced removal from their families, their education, their histories and their lives, a thought that would surely put fear in anyone.</p>
              <p>Yet, they stand together to face the country they grew up in. Undocumented, yes, but unafraid.</p>
